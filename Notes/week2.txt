chapter 4 & 5 
expressions and conditional statements 

assignment is an operator so x = y =z = 0
= operator is right assosiative so i = (j = (k =0));
lvalue is an object stored in computer memory- variables, not a constant or the result of computation
12 = i
i + j = 0
wrong examples

Selection Statements

if/else 
if value is nonvero, statement will be executed
logical operator <,>,+,= etc produce either 09false) or 1(true)

logical error
i< j < k 
correct format
i < j && j <k

C follows the rule that an else clause belongs to the closest if statement

cascaded if else
	if
	else
		if
		else
			if
			else

	if
	else if
	
	else if
