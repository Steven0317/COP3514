escape sequences
increment and decrement operators
loop

escape sequence
\b - backspace 
\n - new line
\t - tab 
\" - double quote
\\ - single quote

Increment & decrement ++ --
++i,--i preincrement, decrement
i++ postincrement, decrement

Loops: while, do, and for

for loop
for(exp1, exp2, exp3)
exp1 = initiialiation
exp2 = condition
exp3 increment
can omit and and all expressions that control a for statement

with commas, for loop can initialize more than one variable

for ( exp a, exp b, condition, increment)

omitting the condition can cause an infinite loop
	ex: for(;;)
while loop
int  i = 10;
While( i > 0)
{
	printf(" T minus %d and counting\n", i);
	i--;
}


break statement transfers control out of a loop
can only transfer control out of one level, nested loops with ounly break to the next heirarchy

for(;;) == for(; n!=0;)

continue statement
	transfers control to a point just before the end of a loop body

null statement
	primarily good for writing loops whose bodies are empty

crt-c terminates an infinite loop
