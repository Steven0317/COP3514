1d arrays

int a[10]
-elements can be on any type the length can be any constant integer expression
use macros to define the length of arrays
#define N 10
int array[N]

elements of an array are from 0 to n-1
to index an array call the array followed by the position within brackets array[4]

boundaries aren't checked in C, if subscript is out of range can experience undefined behavior

if initializer is shorter than the array, the remaining elements are given the value of 0
inta[10] ={0};-initializes the whole array to 0

Mulitdimensional array
C stores 2-d arrays in a row-major order with row 0 first then row 1, etc

nested for loops are best for processing multi dimensional arrays

Arrays can be made constant by starting its declaration with const
-program won't change the array, helps compiler catch errors
