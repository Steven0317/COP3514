++i means increment immediately
i++ means use the old value for now then increment later
can combine *(direction) and ++

compiler sees *p++ = j as
*(p++) and not (*p)++

*p++ is most handy for loops
sum of elements in array:
for(p = &a[0]; p< &a[N]; p++)
sum =+ *p;

int a[10]
*a = 7 means a[0] is 7
*(a+1) = 12 means a[1] is 12
in general (a+1) is the same as a[i]

int * p_min= a
for(p = a+1; p < a+n ;p++)

Segmentation Fault
means trying to access memory that doesnt belong to it
failure to intialize a pointer
forgetting a & or * in scanf of function as pointers
incorrect use of & or *
