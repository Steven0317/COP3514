obtaining File names from the command line
formatted file input and output

scanf("%d", &var);
fscanf ( fp, "%d", &var);
fgets reds in whole line use fgets = null to detect end of file
int fscanf(FILE *pfile, char *format, ...)
int = returns number of variables filled or eof on error
file = poiniter to poen file struct
char = format sting
... = variables to read into


having program obtain file names from command line is best solution
ex: ./a.out name.txt

remember to use
int main(int argc, char * argv[]){
...
}
argc is number of arguments
argv array of pointers to the the argument string

writing formatted output
fprintf function
-writes to stream indicated by first argument

a call of printf is equivilant to fprintf with stdout as the first argument

int fprintf(FILE * pfile, char *format, ...)
int: returns eof on error usally ignored
FILE: pointer to file struct
Char: format string
...: variables to be formatted
